    <p>Religious organisations spent tens of millions of euros in the last decade to shape European Union policy and law making, according to an analysis of datasets and reports by the European Commission and Parliament.
    </p>

    <p>Since the creation of the EU, these institutions lobby by investing money and time to advice members of the European Parliament and European Commission on topics that are relevant to update or change the law.
    </p>

    <p>In the last three years, thousands of religious and non religious bodies spent 2 billion euros on lobbying in the the European Union, according to the EU Transparency Register.
    </p>

    <p>It is legal for Churches and their affiliated organizations to spend money on lobbying and they are taking this opportunity to address a wide variety of issues and to lobby against legal matter practices like abortion and same-sex marriage.
    </p>

    <p>Research on religious lobbying from Dr Lucian N. Leustean, professor at Aston University, showed that there is ‘a widespread perception that religious issues have been absent from the process of European integration’.
    </p>

    <p>Nonetheless, religious organisations have been present at the EU level since its creation and it’s only in 2007, in the Lisbon Treaty that the unofficial has been made official: religious entities can try to influence the law.
    </p>

    <p>Organizations defending Christian values, including One of Us and ADF International, successfully opposed a proposal for a safer legal abortion among other sexual women matters. Finally, an alternative law was passed but it missed the main concern of the initiative.
    </p>

    <p>In the last three years, religious organizations spent 18 million euros on lobbying in the EU. But the organizations expenditure could be even higher, according to Gianluca Sgueo, a research analyst at the European Parliament.
    </p>

    <p>“Transparency International, and another organisation called corporate Europe Observatory they do checks on the register from time to time, and more often than not they realise the numbers are not there in an appropriate way.”</p>

    <p>The Church of Sweden spent more than 13 million in lobbying the EU. This is almost three times more than all the other religious organisations together. Asked about this disproportionate amount, Dr Lucian N. Leustean said ‘I would make a connection between national legislation of church-state relations in Sweden and developments at EU level on religious dialogue’.
    </p>

    <p>Nonetheless, lobbying is not only about money. Meetings  with EU officials  for lobbyists is crucial if they want to shape EU policies. Dr Lucian N. Leustean research reveals that the number of official meetings between EU officials and religious organisations have been up between 1982 and 2008 with a clear dominance of the Catholic and Protestant churches.
    </p>

    <p>The number of meetings underline the power of the COMECE (Commission of the Bishops' Conferences of the European Community) and the EKD (Evanlegical church in Germany) which are two powerful religious organisations.
    </p>

    <p>Most of this registered organisations are Christians. In fact, Christian institutions spent 95 % of the total amount of money spent on lobbying these last three years.They are dominating the religious lobbying scene.

    <p>Religious organizations registered as such in the transparency register don’t account for the numerous religious-affiliated organizations who also lobby the EU.
   </p>

   <p>According to the ‘Study for policy makers on opposition to sexual and reproductive health and rights in Europe’ by Elena Zacharenko, many organizations registered as NGOs in the transparency register are in fact defending religious values.
   </p>

   <p>‘The issues is not with the transparency register it is with what the EU defines as an NGO’ explained Gianluca Sgueo. He added that ‘ a body that has some duties, some tasks in the religious spaces can register legally as an NGO’ because of a lack of regulation.
   </p>

   <p>The Elena Zacharenko report names 20 lobbyists organisations, mostly NGOs, which would have Christian values. If most of them didn’t answer to our questions, The Institute of Bioethics and HazteOir both affirmed that they were not representing any religion.
   </p>

   <p>The Institute of Bioethics denied any involvement in lobbying activities. “We don’t do lobbying but information, we are journalists” claimed Carine Brochier, project manager at the Institute. As for HazteOir, they declared that ‘HazteOir.org and CitizenGO, as non-religious associations with more than 9 million active citizens: atheists, and believers of different religions, all over the world; we defend life, family, and several freedoms: of speech, religious, of education’.
   </p>

   <p>Nonetheless, most of these organisations unified with churches to campaign for or against EU policies. </p>

  <h2 id='title_campaign'>The main sucessful religious campaigns</h2>
  <p>The professionalization of religious lobbying coincides with their participation in new debates as the climate change or immigration.

  But Christian lobbyists’ main fight is and will likely remain what we call the Sexual and Reproductive Health and Right (SRHR). This includes abortion, families right, same-sex marriage… When it comes to these topics, they often unify to try to influence the EU law. Indeed, since 2010, they had some significant victories.

  <div class='para_victory'>

  <p>Most of these campaigns were successful for the religious campaigners either by their importance or their result.
  </p>

  <p>The Edite Estrela report aimed at passing a law to facilitate abortion but the EP finally decided that these decisions should be made by the member states at a national level.
  </p>

  <p>The ‘One of Us’ campaigns started as a European citizens initiative then backed by churches. Their petition to stop EU funding of activities destructing human embryo gathered 1.5 million signatures online. Although their request has been turned down by the European Commission, they are bringing this decision to the European Court of Justice.
  </p>

  <p>The A, B, C v Ireland was a victory for Ireland. The European Court of Justice considered that Ireland constitution doesn’t confer a right to abortion except when it could be life-threatening for the future mother.
  </p>

  <p>#DefundIPPF didn’t lead to the expected result of defunding this organisation, nonetheless, it gave the opportunity to religious lobbyists, affiliated organisations and MEPs to unify and campaign together to try to interfere.
  </p>

  <p>These campaigns, successful or not are strong example of the power of lobbyists when they unify.</p>
